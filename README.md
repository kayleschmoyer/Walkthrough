# Walkthrough 🍫

An animated, **character-guided product walkthrough** for any web page — inspired
by the "4D" character tours at places like Hershey's Chocolate World.

A friendly character pops up, introduces itself, and walks the user through your
UI one step at a time: it **switches to the right tab, spotlights the element,
points at it, and explains what it does** in a speech bubble (with optional spoken
narration). Perfect for onboarding, teaching, and product tours.

## ✨ Features

- 🎭 **Animated SVG character** — blinks, bobs, waves on the intro, and rotates
  its arm to point directly at whatever it's describing.
- 🔦 **Spotlight + dim** — focuses the user on one element at a time.
- 💬 **Typed speech bubble** with optional **browser text-to-speech** narration
  (free, built-in — no API keys) and a mute toggle.
- 🗂️ **Tab-aware** — a step can auto-open the tab/section that contains its target.
- ⌨️ **Keyboard control** — `→`/`Enter` next, `←` back, `Esc` to skip.
- 🔁 **Re-openable** — a floating "Show me around" launcher replays the tour.
- 💾 **Remembers** finished tours via `localStorage` so you only auto-run once.
- 📦 **Framework-agnostic & tiny** — ~6.5 kB gzipped, no dependencies, drops into
  React, Vue, plain HTML, WordPress… anything. Styles inject themselves.

## 🚀 Run the demo locally

This repo ships with a full demo — a mock of the **EnSight portal** (a parking
garage occupancy / vehicle-counting admin dashboard) — so you can see the whole
effect immediately.

### 1. Get the code

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kayleschmoyer/Walkthrough.git
cd Walkthrough

# (If you're reviewing this feature branch specifically:)
git checkout claude/repo-reset-th6zj7
```

> **Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **18 or newer** (this was built
> on Node 22). Check with `node --version`.

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll see output like:

```
  VITE v5.4.x  ready in 231 ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

### 4. Open it

Open **http://localhost:5173/** in your browser.

The tour **auto-starts** on first visit — Pip pops up and guides you through the
dashboard's sections and buttons. Try these:

- Click **Next / Back** (or use arrow keys) to move through the steps.
- Watch Pip spotlight each area — stat cards, the occupancy table, traffic charts —
  and **auto-expand the sidebar's Signage menu** to show nested navigation.
- Click the **🔊 speaker icon** to toggle spoken narration.
- Click **Skip tour**, then use the floating **"Show me around"** button (bottom-right)
  to replay it any time.

> 💡 The tour only auto-runs once (it's remembered in `localStorage`). To force it
> again, open DevTools console and run `tour.start()`, or clear site data.

## 🔌 Use it in your own site

The walkthrough engine lives in [`src/walkthrough/`](src/walkthrough/) and has **no
dependencies**. Copy that folder into your project (or build it with
`npm run build:lib` and import the bundle), then:

```ts
import { Walkthrough } from "./walkthrough";

const tour = new Walkthrough({
  characterName: "Pip",
  accentColor: "#6c5ce7",
  speech: true,                 // narrate aloud with the browser voice
  storageKey: "my-app-tour",    // remember when the user has seen it
  steps: [
    {
      title: "Welcome! 👋",
      text: "I'll show you around in 30 seconds.",
      // no `target` → the character speaks "to camera", centered
    },
    {
      target: "#settings-btn",   // CSS selector or an HTMLElement
      title: "Settings",
      text: "Open your settings from here.",
      side: "left",              // optional: auto | left | right | top | bottom
    },
    {
      openTab: '#tab-billing',   // clicked first, so the target becomes visible
      target: "#upgrade-btn",
      title: "Upgrade",
      text: "And this is where you upgrade your plan.",
    },
  ],
  onFinish: () => console.log("done!"),
});

// Auto-run for first-time users, and always offer a replay button:
tour.mountLauncher("Show me around");
if (!tour.completed) tour.start();
```

### Step options

| Field      | Type                                          | Description                                            |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `target`   | `string \| HTMLElement`                       | Element to spotlight & point at. Omit for "to camera". |
| `title`    | `string`                                      | Optional bold heading.                                 |
| `text`     | `string`                                      | What the character says (typed + spoken).              |
| `openTab`  | `string \| HTMLElement`                       | Clicked **before** the step so the target is visible.  |
| `side`     | `"auto" \| "left" \| "right" \| "top" \| "bottom"` | Preferred placement of the character.             |
| `padding`  | `number`                                      | Extra px around the highlighted element.               |
| `onShow`   | `(step, index) => void`                       | Runs when the step becomes active.                     |

### Walkthrough options

`characterName`, `accentColor`, `speech`, `startMuted`, `keyboard`, `storageKey`,
plus callbacks `onFinish`, `onSkip`, `onStep`. See
[`src/walkthrough/types.ts`](src/walkthrough/types.ts) for the full, documented API.

### Controlling the tour

```ts
tour.start();        // begin (true = from the start, false = resume)
tour.next();         // advance
tour.prev();         // go back
tour.goTo(2);        // jump to a step
tour.skip();         // dismiss early
tour.destroy();      // tear down completely
tour.completed;      // boolean — has this user finished it before?
```

## 🎭 The guide character (2D mascot or real-time 3D avatar)

There are two built-in characters, both satisfying the same `CharacterHandle`
contract (`point()` / `rest()` / `wave()` / `hop()`), so the controller drives
either one unchanged:

### Animated SVG mascot (default)
Plain inline SVG in [`character.ts`](src/walkthrough/character.ts), driven by CSS
variables — recolor it with `accentColor` or swap the SVG for your own art. Tiny
and dependency-free.

### Real-time 3D avatar
A rigged glTF character rendered with [three.js](https://threejs.org) that plays
skeletal animations (idle / wave / jump / gesture) and yaws to face the element
it's describing. Enable it with the `characterFactory` option:

Animations are referenced by **logical role** (`idle` / `greet` / `walk` /
`gesture`), so any rigged humanoid works. Point `animations` at separate
animation `.glb` files to retarget them onto a model that ships none:

```ts
import { Walkthrough, createAvatar3D } from "./walkthrough";

new Walkthrough({
  characterFactory: () =>
    createAvatar3D({
      url: "/avatar/character.glb",            // a rigged humanoid
      animations: {                            // retargeted by bone name
        idle: "/avatar/anims/idle.glb",
        greet: "/avatar/anims/greet.glb",
        walk: "/avatar/anims/walk.glb",
        gesture: "/avatar/anims/gesture.glb",
        celebrate: "/avatar/anims/celebrate.glb", // optional: final-step celebration
      },
    }),
  steps: [ /* ... */ ],
});
```

- The demo ships with a **custom cartoon guide** (`public/avatar/character.glb`) —
  a character generated in [3D AI Studio](https://www.3daistudio.com), auto-rigged
  on [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com), then decimated + texture-compressed for the
  web (1 M verts / 80 MB → ~7 MB). Her Mixamo clips (idle / waving / walking /
  pointing) live in [`public/avatar/anims/`](public/avatar/anims) as tiny
  animation-only `.glb`s. three.js's lighter `RobotExpressive` robot is also bundled.
- She **greets** you on the intro, **walks** over and **points** at each element as
  she explains it, and **celebrates** on the final step — while staying turned
  toward the viewer. (`entrance` and `celebrate` are optional roles; the controller
  falls back to a wave when they're absent.)
- Narration auto-picks a natural female English voice (override with the `voice`
  option, e.g. `voice: "Samantha"`).
- While narrating she **"talks"** with procedural head/neck motion synced to the
  narration. (The generated mesh has no facial blendshapes or jaw bone, so true
  viseme lip-sync isn't possible on it — for real mouth movement, use an avatar
  with ARKit blendshapes, e.g. Ready Player Me, and drive its visemes.)
- **Make your own** the same way: generate a character (3D AI Studio, Ready Player
  Me, Avaturn…), rig + grab animations on Mixamo, export FBX, and I convert them to
  optimized `.glb`. Map clips to roles (`idle`/`greet`/`walk`/`gesture`) via
  `animations` (external clips) or `anims` (clips embedded in the model). See
  [`src/demo/main.ts`](src/demo/main.ts).
- Trade-off: this pulls in three.js (~150 kB gzipped) + the model + clip files, so
  it's no longer the tiny drop-in widget. Use the SVG mascot, or the much smaller
  robot, when bundle size matters.
